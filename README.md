# Word2Vec
1. Word2Vec tries to calculate the word embeddings for different words and tries to predict highly similar and dissimilar pairs of words for different sets of words.
2. The code uses two different loss functions for doing this, namely the cross-entropy loss and noise contrastive estimation loss. The        implementation for these functions in tensorflow can be found in the loss_func.py
